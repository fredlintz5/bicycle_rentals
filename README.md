 # Bicycle Rental Web App
> My focus with this site is to make an application for businesses to manage their rental fleets.

>Initially I will set it up for internal employee use, checking availability, storing customer data, customer waivers, and recieving payments. 

>Down the line, Id like it to have the ability to embed into a retailer's website, allowing for customer interaction, and rental reservations.

>Also, I'd like to provide the retailer with a dashboard to manage their fleet, rates, see trends and export customer data.
