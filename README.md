My focus with this site is to make an online outlet for bicycle retail shops to manage their rental fleets.

Initially I will set it up for internal employee use, checking availability, storing customer data, customer waivers, and recieving payments. 

Down the line, Id like it to embed into a retailer's website, alowing customer interaction, and rental reservations.

Also, I'd like to provide the retailer with a dashboard to manage bikes, rates, see trends and retrieve customer data for input into POS systems.
