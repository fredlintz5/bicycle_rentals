My focus with this site is to make an application for businesses to manage their rental fleets.

Initially I will set it up for internal employee use, checking availability, storing customer data, customer waivers, and recieving payments. 

Down the line, Id like it to have the ability to embed into a retailer's website, allowing for customer interaction, and rental reservations.

Also, I'd like to provide the retailer with a dashboard to manage their fleet, rates, see trends and export customer data.
